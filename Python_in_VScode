name: Provides the name for the debug configuration that appears in the VS Code dropdown list.
type: Identifies the type of debugger to use.
request: Specifies the mode in which to start debugging: launch/attach

args: Specifies arguments to pass to the Python program.
justMyCode: When omitted or set to true (the default), restricts debugging to user-written code only. Set to false to also enable debugging of standard library functions.
